# ChainShot-AAVE-Security


Taking advantage of AAVE flash loans to gain unfair voting power in poorly designed governance protocols, FlashVoter.sol contains an interesting but potentially dangerous concept.

Such methods have been used before on well-established [projects](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/urgent-flash-loans-and-securing-the-maker-protocol/4901) calling for developers to rethink protocol implementation and security.






### Development-Goals

ðŸ¤– Expand Solidity knowledge

ðŸ§° Develop deeper understanding of DeFi and AAVE protocols

ðŸ’° Understand potential security vulnerabilities  within smart contracts and governance protocols




## Built With

* [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/)
* [AAVE](https://docs.aave.com/developers/)
